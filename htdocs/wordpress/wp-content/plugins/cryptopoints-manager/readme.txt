== Description ==**Cryptopoints Manager** Cryptopoints Manager, a joint collaboration between CodeAndMore.com and Cryptidcurrency.org, is a gamification style point management system where users can earn points on a WP site by completing tasks specified by the site administrator. 

Users earn their points by regularly logging in, posting comments, sharing on social media and creating posts. As users increase points, their ranking also increases and is displayed using ready-to-go widgets. The best part of all (this is where cryptocurrency comes in to play); users can receive cryptocurrency rewards based on their accumulated points and leaderboard ranking!
